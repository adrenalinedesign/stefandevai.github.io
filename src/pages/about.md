Hi :)

I'm Stefan Devai, a History Student at the Sorbonne University in Paris and a Computer Science enthusiast. In this blog I can share some of my programming experiments and historical essays I've written.

I actively use four languages for differents aspects of my life, so you will find here posts in Spanish, Portuguese, English and French.

I use [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) as my operating system, [i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) as my window manager and [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)/[GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) as my text editors. This blog was made using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).
